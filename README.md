# TrackerForm-Dashboard(--WIP--)
This is a dashboard which will help fill the tracker form. Just upload a csv file and start with basic analysis.

Built using Streamlit.

Steps to use:
1. Add a csv file to start cleaning.
2. (for indian datasets) use the states to plot the data on a map, shapefile is included in the directory(more countries can be supported)
3. Filter out data by manually selecting columns to filter out from. eg: if a csv has 10 columns, one of them being the indicator, you can filter out data
   for that particular indicator.
4. Visualise the results and compare it with the raw data.
